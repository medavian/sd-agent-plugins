Configuring the agent
---
The first time you install a plugin you need to set the agent up. After that, you can just drop a new plugin into the plugin directory, then restart the agent.

1. Create a directory where you want to store your plugins. The agent needs to have write access to this directory so we recommend the same location the agent is installed, usually `/usr/bin/sd-agent/plugins/`
2. Set the `plugin_directory` agent config value to the full path to this new directory e.g. `/usr/bin/sd-agent/plugins/`
3. Place any plugins into this new directory.
4. Restart the agent.

Troubleshooting plugins
---
[Place the agent into debug mode](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/200495543-Debug-mode-Linux-FreeBSD-Mac) and check [the logs](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/201244753-Agent-logs) to see what the plugin is doing.

You can see what is being sent back to us from the "Plugins" tab when viewing the device in the Server Density web UI.
